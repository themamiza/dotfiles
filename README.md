# dotfiles
This repository hosts my personal configuration files (dotfiles).

## Installation
Currently there are no actual "installation scripts".
`marbs` and `marbs-python` are experimental branches that will probably be removed in favor of another script that will be worked on; on the `master` branch.
You can install the dotfiles by manually copying the files into your home directory and installing the dependencies.
